  title: "How to Calm Yourself During an Anxiety Attack",
  notes: "Anxiety is an experience everyone feels from time to time. You may even suffer from an anxiety disorder, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), if you experience persistent, unrealistic worrying about everyday life.[1] However, if you experience abrupt attacks where you have symptoms like racing heart, nausea, tremors, and intense fear, you may be having panic attacks.[2] Panic attacks can be scary, so it's helpful to know that you can limit them when they occur. With a little mindful attention and practice, you can help relieve the symptoms of a panic attack, manage your anxiety, and prevent attacks from occurring in the future.",
